Ox Folder Structure Generator
=============================

## To-do

- Make this run anywhere in the system (specify root path)
- Ask the user for project name and name folders accordingly
- Save the OxFolders file on the server and read it dynamically
- Make an automator app/service to run this without the terminal
- Would this be easier in Python?
